</div>
<div class="descp">
    <p>If you are struggling to afford your medication, you are not alone. Over 40 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured and make daily choices between paying for their medication or basic living necessities. Many people go without medication or take less than prescribed due to the costs involved. This is a serious crises for many families as it drastically affects quality of life and can sometimes keep people from having medication that can save their lives.</p>

    <p>Paying for medication shouldn’t be something someone has to worry about, but it is. It is a choice most have to make, a choice between buying food, gas, paying rent or filling a needed prescription. </p>
    <p>Nearly 45 million Americans have no health insurance, and millions more have limited coverage. Many Americans just can't afford health care, and, if they can, they don't have the money to buy their medicines. </p>
    <p>Luckily, there is help available for many people who cannot afford their medication. Most pharmaceutical companies offer a Patient Assistance Program (PAP) to help patients obtain the medication they need.</p>
    <p>Each Patient Assistance Program has their own set of rules, guidelines and procedures. <br>They allhave income guidelines, but they vary considerably. Each company selects which drugs are available on their programs and how long a person can receive assistance.</p>
    <p>All Programs require a complete application. Each application is different and the required information will vary by PAP. Some programs require detailed medical and financial information, while others will not. Certain programs require the doctor to complete a portion of the form and others only need a signed prescription. Medication shipment will also vary by the Doctor’s office, patient’s home or their local pharmacy. Enrollment period for most PAPs is one year, depending if you have Medicare, your enrollment will go until the end of the calendar year</p>
    <p>Your doctor is NOT the best source of information on PAPs. Surprisingly, many doctors don't even know PAPs exist. The same applies for pharmacists. Many social workers know about the programs but do not know about their requirements.Here at Prescription Lifeline it is our goal to get you the most assistance with your medication. Since 2002 we have been researching PAP guidelines and working hand in hand with them to get as many members as possible the medication they need for little to NO COST.  </p>
