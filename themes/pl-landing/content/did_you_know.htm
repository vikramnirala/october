    <p>Over 93% of people who have a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan are not sure if it's the best one available to them... or even what medications it will cover if they need them. </p>
    <p>Many seniors just buy the cheapest thing, not knowing that it may have huge deductibles or bureaucracy involved if they need medications later.  </p>
    <div class="items">
        <p class="blck">The sources of confusion Medicare Patients have with Medicare Part D Plans are endless.... but here are the end results.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They pay way too much for the plan</li>
            <li>The plan does not cover the medications they need</li>
            <li>Even if it does cover your medication, it may require laborious processes (that are difficult to understand and follow) to get the particular medicine your doctor prescribes.</li>
            <li>When sick, they have to fight with the insurance company to get help... at the time when you are least able to.</li>
            <li>Once you realize you have the wrong plan, they make you wait for up to a year before you can find the right plan for you.</li>
            <li>Even then, the insurance companies can change their coverages including the medications they cover in the middle of the year,.... after you are already "locked in."</li>
            <li>Many suffer permanent health consequences and even premature death because they didn't get the care they needed... even when it would have been available had they done the right things. </li>
        </ul>
